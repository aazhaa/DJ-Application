# DJ Application - Object Oriented Programming Final Project

Welcome to my final project source files, the "DJ Application," developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming Language course at Goldsmith University of London! Using Juce Library.

## Overview

This repository showcases my final project, the "DJ Application," which demonstrates my proficiency in object-oriented programming and graphical user interface (GUI) development using the Juice library.

## Project Description

**Project Name:** DJ Application

**Project Description:** The DJ Application is a graphical music player and mixer tool created using the Juice C++ library. It enables users to load and play audio tracks, apply various audio effects, and mix tracks seamlessly. This project serves as a practical application of object-oriented programming principles and GUI development techniques learned during the course.

## Contents

Here's what you'll find in this repository:

1. **Source Code:** The heart of the DJ Application lies in its source code. I've structured the codebase using object-oriented design principles to maintain modularity and extensibility.

2. **Documentation:** To facilitate your understanding of the project, I've provided comprehensive documentation. This documentation covers project requirements, design decisions, and instructions for building and running the DJ Application.

3. **Demo and Screenshots:** You can get a visual insight into the DJ Application's features through screenshots and, if available, a demonstration video.

4. **Project Milestones:** Throughout the development process, I've utilized Git and version control to track project milestones and evolution.

## Getting Started

Download Juce Library -> https://juce.com/get-juce/

Copy the files in User folder of you windows example. C:\Users\YourName\ -< Juce folder here

Then create an Basic GUI Application using Projucer

Then copy these source file in it.
