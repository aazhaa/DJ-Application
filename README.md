# DJ Application - Object Oriented Programming Final Project

Welcome to my final project source files, the "DJ Application," developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming Language course at Goldsmith University of London! Using Juce Library.

## Overview

This repository showcases my final project, the "DJ Application," which demonstrates my proficiency in object-oriented programming and graphical user interface (GUI) development using the Juice library.

## Project Description

**Project Name:** DJ Application

**Project Description:** The DJ Application is a graphical music player and mixer tool created using the Juice C++ library. It enables users to load and play audio tracks, apply various audio effects, and mix tracks seamlessly. This project serves as a practical application of object-oriented programming principles and GUI development techniques learned during the course.

## Contents

Here's what you'll find in this repository:

1. **Source Code:** The heart of the DJ Application lies in its source code. I've structured the codebase using object-oriented design principles to maintain modularity and extensibility.

2. **Project Overview:** I have provided a comprehensive overview of the project to facilitate your understanding. This overview covers all the key aspects of the project, including its requirements, design decisions, and instructions for building and running the DJ Application.

3. **Demo and Screenshots:** You can get a visual insight into the DJ Application's features through screenshots and, if available, a demonstration video.

4. **Project Milestones:** Throughout the development process, I've utilized Git and version control to track project milestones and evolution.
